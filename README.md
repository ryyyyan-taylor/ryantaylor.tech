This is the source code for my personal website, [ryantaylor.tech](https://ryantaylor.tech). This is still very much a work in progress sight, but a fun way to work on my frontend skills and also show off some of what I do!
  
This site was based off a template I found from [MacodeID](https://www.macodeid.com/), and all rights go to them over there of course.
